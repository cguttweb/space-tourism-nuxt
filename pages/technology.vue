    <h3>The terminology...</h3>
    <h1>Space capsule</h1>

    <p class="body-text">
      A space capsule is an often-crewed spacecraft that uses a blunt-body reentry capsule
      to reenter the Earth's atmosphere without wings. Our capsule is where you'll spend
      your time during the flight. It includes a space gym, cinema, and plenty of other
      activities to keep you entertained.
